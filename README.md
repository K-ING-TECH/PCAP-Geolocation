##Overview
How to use Wireshark to analyze a packet capture (PCAP) file, correlate IP addresses with geographic locations, and visualize the data to identify potential security threats, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Steps:
1. Install and Set Up MaxMind Database
To get started, we need to install a GeoIP database that Wireshark can use to resolve IP addresses to geographic locations.

Sign Up at MaxMind:

Go to the MaxMind website and sign up for a free account.
No credit card is required; just provide your basic information.
Download GeoIP Databases:

After signing in, navigate to the “Download Databases” section.
Download the ASN, City, and Country databases in ZIP format (not CSV).
Extract these files and place them into a dedicated folder on your computer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Configure Wireshark to Use MaxMind Database
Open Wireshark Preferences:
Go to Edit > Preferences (On Mac, it might be under a different menu).
Navigate to Name Resolution.
Under MaxMind Database Directories, click Edit, and point Wireshark to the folder where you saved the extracted GeoIP files.
Restart Wireshark to apply the changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Analyze Packet Captures
Open a PCAP File:

Load your packet capture file in Wireshark.
Investigate Potential Scans:

Look for suspicious activity, such as multiple SYN packets from different IP addresses. This could indicate a scan or an attempted attack.
Expand the IPv4 section in a packet’s details to see geolocation data, such as country code, latitude, and longitude.
Visualize Geolocation Data:

Go to Statistics > Endpoints, select IPv4, and scroll through the list to see geolocation details.
Use Map > Open in Browser to generate a heat map of IP addresses’ geographic locations. This visual representation helps identify where potential threats are originating.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Filter and Explore Specific Data
Filter by Country:

Right-click on a packet, and use the Prepare as Filter option to filter traffic by source country using the syntax ip.geoip.country == "CN" (for China, for example).
This can help you isolate traffic from specific countries and analyze the associated packets.
Explore Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs):

Note the ASN number associated with the IPs, and research them to understand their origin, possibly identifying any malicious intent.
Check Time to Live (TTL) Values:

Inspect TTL values to gauge how far away an IP address might be and possibly correlate it with the geographic data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Identify DDoS Attacks
Look for Common Patterns:

Identical IP identification numbers across different IP addresses may indicate that the traffic is being generated by a script or tool, typical of a DDoS attack.
Observe the sequence numbers and IP addresses to identify potential spoofed traffic.
Take Action:

Based on your findings, consider security actions like blacklisting suspicious IP addresses or ranges.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
This covers the basics of setting up Wireshark for geolocation analysis and how to use this data to investigate potential security threats. 
You can gain insights into where malicious traffic might be coming from and take appropriate actions to secure your network.
